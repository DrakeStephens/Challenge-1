# Code Refactor Starter Code
I'm supposed to clean up the website and make sure that it fucntioning correctly and organized.
The following is the list of steps that I have done to meet these requirements:
1. I added an ID to the <div> element containing the class "search-engine-optimization"
2. I organized the style.css
3. I changed the names of the <div> elements containing the classes: content and benifits to minimize "div soup".
4. I added alt's to the three images in the content section.
5. Changed each of the individual blocks within the content class. Again, to remove "div soup".
(next is the sequential order)

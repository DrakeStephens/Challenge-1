# Code Refactor Starter Code
I'm supposed to clean up the website and make sure that it fucntioning correctly and organized.
The following is the list of steps that I have done to meet these requirements:
1. I added an ID to the <div> element containing the class "search-engine-optimization"
2. I organized the style.css
3. I changed the names of the <div> elements containing the content and benifits and replaced them with <section> element. To minimize "div soup".
4. I added alt's to the three images in the content section.
5. Changed each of the individual blocks within the content class and replaced them with the <article> element. Again, to remove "div soup".
6. Changed the Title to match the <h1> of the header to be more clear.

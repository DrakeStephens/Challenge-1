I'm supposed to clean up the website and make sure that it functioning correctly and organized. The following is the list of steps that I have done to meet these requirements:

I added an ID to the (div) element containing the class "search-engine-optimization".

I organized the style.css.

I changed the names of the (div) elements containing the content and benefits and replaced them with (section) elements. To minimize "div soup".

I added alts to the three images in the content section.

Changed each of the individual blocks within the content class and replaced them with the (article) element. Again, to remove "div soup".

Changed the Title to match the (h1) of the header to be more clear.

My goal was to not stray away from the looks of this screenshot, only to fix and organize the inaccuracies. Also, to add certain elements to make the website more appealing to search engines. https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/235/files/71328/download.
